# Ship Classification in Satellite Images
In this project a convolutional neural network model was created for ship classification in satellite images. 
For this project "Ships in Satellite Imagery" dataset was used.

## Dataset Properties

 * The specific Dataset includes 4000 images labeled with either a "ship" or "no-ship" classification.
 * These 4000 images are in .png format and have dimensions of 80 Ã— 80 pixels. 
 * The colour depth of the above 4000 images is 24 bit (8 bits per channel).
 * Image chips were derived from PlanetScope full-frame visual scene products, which are orthorectified to a 3 meter pixel size.
 * The "ship" class includes 1000 images. Images in this class are near-centered on the body of a single ship. Ships of different sizes, orientations, and atmospheric collection conditions are included.
 * Each individual image filename follows a specific format: {label} __ {scene id} __ {longitude} _ {latitude}.png
   * label: Valued 1 or 0, representing the "ship" class and "no-ship" class, respectively.
   * scene id: The unique identifier of the PlanetScope visual scene the image chip was extracted from. 
   * longitude_latitude: The longitude and latitude coordinates of the image center point, with values separated by a single underscore.
